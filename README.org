* Languages

This repo I'm using to learn languages from any source.
Some files should be only the classes that I'm seeing or sometimes some challenges so I can try and see if I can resolve them.

Each language that I will be studying should have a directory for it so the navigation will be self-sufficient.

All the files should be on =.org= so I can also practice literate programming.

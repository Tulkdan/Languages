Separates the software in layers, called the presentation layer, business layers, persistent layers and database layer.

Not a rule, but usually it can be only 3 layers, merging the persistent and database layers.

It is usually the de factor go to.

| Layer        | Responsability                                                |
|--------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Presentation | handling all user interface and browser communication logic   |
| business     | execute specific business rules associated with the request   |
| persistent   | responsible to make the communication with the database layer |
| database     | responsible to know how to get the data from DB               |

Each layer in the architecture forms an abstraction around the work that needs to be tone to satisfy a particular buseness request
